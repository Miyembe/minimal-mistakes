 ## Miyembe's Blog!
 
 ### What is Miyembe?

Miyembe means "mango" in Lusoga, one of the local launguages in Uganda.

### What do I post?

I post a summary of research papers in __Pepperoni__, code in __cod__, and any thought in __Ideas__.

### What do I wanna do?

I would like to archive my paper summaries and share it to others. Also, I would like to share the process of learning during PhD to colleagues (you all!) for encouragement. I also want to share useful codes and tips in my blog. Welcome everyone.
